# aslm-creo

ASLM Plugin for Creo

## Prerequisites
- CMake
- VSCode 2019 (2022 probably works)
- CMake plugin for VSCode

## Settings

There are a couple of environment variables that must be set to correctly build the plugin.

```
CREO_TOOLKIT=<dir-of-protktools> # Example: C:\Program Files\PTC\Creo 10.0.0.0\Common Files\protoolkit
PROTOOL_DEBUG=<debug-level> # Example: crash
PROTOOL_LOG_DIR=<debug-dir> # Example: C:\projects\aslm-creo\build
```

You must also change the `creotk.dat` file to have the correct absolute paths.

## Installation

```
cmake --build build
```

## Debugging

Use MSVC to debug the application. The project file is in the `build` directory and generated by CMake.

1. Make sure to start Creo, but don't load the plugin or do anything else, or the debugger won't be able to attach to the correct process
2. Attach to the `xtop.exe` process
3. Place breakpoints and start debugging

## Strategy

1. Create sketch
1. Fill 2D sketch with Datum points for the lattice structure using the plugin
1. Extrude 2D sketch so that we have a volume and a Datum axis (for all points) using Creo
1. Depending on the cell and strategy we fill the volume with points along the axis using the plugin
1. Generate 3D lattice structure from points using the plugin. We can sweep between the different points to create a lattice structure and copy the structure
